# Prehistoric-raised-field-detection
University final year individual project: Using Computer Vision to Map Ancient Landscape Engineering in the Mompos Depression, Columbia. This is achieved by creating and training a U-Net model to perform semantic segmentation.

## Artefact Folder
The Artefact folder contains a python script 'detect_camellones.py' that feeds images inside the 'Input Images' folder through model and utilises an OpenCV window to help the user optmise the predictions. The output images get saved in the 'Output Folder'. The file size of the model is too large to upload here.

## Model Experiments and Data
U_Net.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook file that shows the creation and optimisation of the U-Net model. Everything inside the Individual Project folder is the training data.

## Other
A python script that performs data augmentation.

## Take Screenshot
A browser plugin that takes a screenshot of the satellite imagery found on Bing Maps.
